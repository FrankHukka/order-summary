### Links

- Live Site URL: [Live Site](https://frankhukka.github.io/order-summary/)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- HTML tables

### What I learned

In this challenge I wanted to try the table element of HTML to create the plan info box. Otherwise I used the CSS Flexbox that I had tried in my previous challenge solution (QR code component). Coding the hover states was interesting to learn.

### Continued development

Next time I would try using CSS Grid for similar projects.

### Useful resources

- [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn) - Very useful courses on CSS and HTML.
